What is happening in the background?
Keyboard input interrupts CPU to forward it to the browser application
Browser application then combines this information with its own cookies to pipe a query to the google server over ethernet or Wifi connection. 
The ethernet frame encapuslated into an 802.11 packet or sent over ethernet cable is intercepted by  an access point /eventually a switch point and then eventually to the intended IP address (Google server). 
Google server possibly implements a hashing algorithm to match it to known queries. Matching queries are sent back to the browswer application.
User selects a query or continues to type. This loop repeats untill a querie is finalized. 
Google responds with the results that match this query.
